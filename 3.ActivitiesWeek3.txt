Exercise 1: Calculate Salary with Tax
# Input employee details
employee_name = input("Enter employee name: ")
hourly_rate = float(input("Enter hourly rate: "))
weekly_hours = float(input("Enter weekly hours: "))

# Calculate salary before tax
salary = hourly_rate * weekly_hours

# Calculate tax based on hourly rate
if hourly_rate > 45:
    tax_rate = 0.02
else:
    tax_rate = 0.01

tax = salary * tax_rate

# Calculate net salary
net_salary = salary - tax

# Display results
print(f"Employee: {employee_name}")
print(f"Salary before tax: ${salary:.2f}")
print(f"Tax: ${tax:.2f}")
print(f"Net Salary: ${net_salary:.2f}")

Exercise 2: Calculate Student Grade
# Input student's mark
mark = float(input("Enter the student's mark: "))

# Determine the grade
if mark < 50:
    grade = "Fail"
elif 50 <= mark < 60:
    grade = "Pass"
elif 60 <= mark < 80:
    grade = "Credit"
else:
    grade = "Distinction"

# Display the grade
print(f"Student Grade: {grade}")

Exercise 3: Check Odd or Even
# Input a number
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Check if the number is Odd or Even
if number % 2 == 0:
    result = "Even"
else:
    result = "Odd"

# Display the result
print(f"The number is {result}.")

Exercise 4: Check First Character for Vowel
# Input user name
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Check if the first character is a vowel
if user_name[0].lower() in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']:
    print("The first character is a VOWEL.")
else:
    print("The first character is a CONSONANT.")

Exercise 5: Check User's Color Choice
# Input user's color choice

if color.lower() in ["green", "orange"]:
    print("You win.")

    print("Sorry!")

Exercise 6: Fortune Telling Program
# Input favorite number, color, and floating point number
favorite_number = int(input("Enter your favorite number from 1 to 50: "))
favorite_color = input("Enter your favorite color (red, grey, or black): ")
floating_number = float(input("Enter a floating-point number from 1 to 10: "))

# Determine the fortune
if favorite_number < 9 or (favorite_color.lower() == "grey" and floating_number == 8.43):
    fortune = "You will win the lottery soon"
elif favorite_number != 10 and (favorite_color.lower() == "red" or floating_number <= 1.79):
    fortune = "You will live to 110"
elif (favorite_number >= 26 and favorite_color.lower() == "black") or floating_number == 8.2:
    fortune = "You will become the next prime minister"

    fortune = "I cannot read your fortune"
